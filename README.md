# pinapp_challenge

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This minimal app shows a list of posts fetched from jsonplaceholder.typicode.com, and allows the user can tap on any of them and retrieve the list of comments of itself.

The project has built using:
- Clean architecture pattern
- BLoC as state management library
- Freezed with json serialization to modelate the post entity from API
- A service built on Swift language (to fetch post comments), and communicating with Flutter through Pigeon library
